# Hey, I'm Sakib Hussen! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science and Data Science undergrad at Goucher College (Class of 2026), passionate about machine learning, data analysis, and building impactful tools. With a 4.0 GPA and hands-on experience in Python, TensorFlow, and AWS, I love tackling real-world problemsâ€”like predicting land surface temperatures or analyzing genomic data.

### What I Do
- **Machine Learning**: Built models with TensorFlow (e.g., MobileNetV2 on CIFAR-10, 82% accuracy) and Bayesian Neural Networks.
- **Data Science**: Processed 669,000+ data points for urban heat studies and 10,000+ survey entries for poverty prediction.
- **Projects**: Created a disaster preparedness AI app (1st place hackathon winner) and sentiment analysis tools.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Java, SQL
- **Tools**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Git, Docker, CI/CD
- **Cloud**: AWS, GCP
